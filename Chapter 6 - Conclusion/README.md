# Chapter 6 - Conclusion #

So we're finished! We have a functioning ESP and aimbot and a very detailed writeup of the journey.<br>
However, there's always room for improvement. In this chapter, a few things will be covered:
1. Adding more features (god-mode, infinite ammo, no recoil, perfect accuracy, higher fire rate)
2. Adding an ImGui menu for users to configure various settings in-game
3. Cleaning up the code (why did I make everything static...?)

Code will be pushed after each major point and tagged.
